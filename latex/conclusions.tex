\section{Conclusions}

\textcolor{gray}{Accuracy error achieved, during the training of the model, the we need to compare the result achieved by testing the model on the whole test set.\\ Notice that the drop of the accuracy, hence the accuracy is discovered already at the 10 epoch/iteration of the algorithms. Comparing the three algorithm is almost the faster one, the competing algorithm in terms of speed convergence of the noise is the distributed.}
