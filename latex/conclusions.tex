\section{Conclusions}

In this report we have focused on the problem of producing universal adversarial perturbations by analizing three Stochastic Gradient Free Frank-Wolfe algorithms. In particular, we have shown that Decentralized and Distributed SGF FW algorithms create more clear patterns on the perturbation, covering the majority of the digit space, while Decentralized Variance-Reduced SGF FW produces a perturbation with no clear pattern and randomly spread.\\
\indent What's more, we have seen that the algorithm that reached better results in terms of misclassification is Algorithm \ref{decentralized} that lowered the accuracy to 55\%. In this sense, the worst was Algorithm \ref{variance-reduced} that was unable to got down 84\% of accuracy.\\


% confronto pattern --> how the noise is spread in the perturbation
% confronto accuracy --> small accuracy, best algorithm
% confronto running-time?
