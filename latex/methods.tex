\section{Methods}
Recently, decentralized and distributed settings are getting significant attention due the need to exploit data parallelizability in case of complex model trained on huge data, that typically require a storage that exceeds the machine capacity. In brief, in decentralized setups the devices (or workers) exchange information with a master node, while in distributed setups the devices are connected in a peer-to-peer manner and therefore exchange information only with their neighbors. \\ 
The following optimization algorithm are designed to accomodate distributed data across multiple devices calls.
