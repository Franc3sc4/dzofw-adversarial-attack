\subsection{Decentralized Variance-Reduced SGF FW Experiments}
For the Variance-Reduced FW algorithm we consider 5 workers and with 800 different images each, i.e. 160 images per digit. We set the number of queries to 20 and the number of component functions $S_2 = 3$. We then run the Algorithm \ref{variance-reduced} for $q=5,7,9$ and $n=5,10$. The choice for the values of $q$ is because of the different number of calling to the KWSA, while the $n$ parameter identify the different number of component function.\\

DA SPIEGARE MEGLIO, QUESTA PARTE NON L'AVEVO CAPITA MOLTO BENE :(

In Figure \ref{fig:variance-reduced} we can see an example of the perturbations.
